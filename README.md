# PSIRAGCN
we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework composed of pattern and spatial modules.
This is the pytorch implementation of PSIRAGCN. I hope these codes are helpful to you!

# Requirements
The code is built based on Python 3.9.12, PyTorch 1.11.0, and NumPy 1.21.2.
# Datasets
We provide preprocessed datasets that you can access here. If you need the original datasets, please refer to [STSGCN](https://github.com/Davidham3/STSGCN) (including PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08)
