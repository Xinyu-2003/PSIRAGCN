# PSIRAGCN
we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework composed of pattern and spatial modules.
This is the pytorch implementation of PSIRAGCN. I hope these codes are helpful to you!
